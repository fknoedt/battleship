# Code Challenges

These are a few random code challenges I went through. Due to the restricted time and rights reserved, most won't have the full test description.

## battleship

[battleship.php]()

Algorithm and data structure test: return information about the damaged and sunk ships given positions and shots.

This code was built for a restricted time challenge which required that the `solution` _function_ returned the correct response based on different inputs. Performance would not be taken into account.

## fizz-buzz

[fizz-buzz.php](fizz-buzz.php)

Prints the numbers from 1 to MAX. For multiples of three, prints 'Fizz'; for multiples of five prints 'Buzz';for multiples of both three and five prints 'FizzBuzz'

## palindrome

[palindrome.php](palindrome.php)

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
 
Write a program in any language to find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

## tic tac toe

[tic-tac-toe.php](tic-tac-toe.php)
